## üéØ What ALNS Does

### Algorithm Overview:
```
1. Start with greedy solution (from Phase 0)
2. Loop for N iterations:
   a. SELECT destroy operator (weighted random)
   b. SELECT repair operator (weighted random)
   c. DESTROY: Remove 1-3 orders from solution
   d. REPAIR: Reinsert orders optimally
   e. ACCEPT/REJECT using Simulated Annealing
   f. UPDATE operator weights based on performance
3. Return best solution found
```

### Destroy Operators:
- **RandomRemoval**: Randomly remove orders
- **WorstRemoval**: Remove orders with highest cost
- **ShawRemoval**: Remove related orders (similar in time/space)

### Repair Operators:
- **GreedyInsertion**: Insert at lowest cost position
- **Regret2Insertion**: Prioritize hard-to-insert orders

## üéõÔ∏è Tuning Parameters

In `test_phase1.py`, you can adjust:

```python
best_solution, stats = alns.optimize(
    initial_solution=initial_solution,
    max_iterations=500,          # More = better solution (slower)
    temperature_start=1000.0,    # Higher = more exploration
    temperature_end=0.1,         # Lower = more exploitation
    cooling_rate=0.995,          # Slower = more exploration
    destroy_size_min=1,          # Min orders to remove
    destroy_size_max=3           # Max orders to remove
)
```

### Quick tuning guide:
- **Fast test**: `max_iterations=200`
- **Balanced**: `max_iterations=500` (default)
- **High quality**: `max_iterations=1000+`

## üìà Success Criteria

### Excellent Solution:
- ‚úÖ Coverage ‚â• 95%
- ‚úÖ Violations = 0
- ‚úÖ Cost reduction > 20%

### Good Solution:
- ‚úÖ Coverage ‚â• 90%
- ‚úÖ Violations ‚â§ 2
- ‚úÖ Cost reduction > 10%

### Needs Improvement:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Coverage < 90%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Violations > 2
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cost reduction < 10%

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Import Error
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'RandomRemoval'
```
**Fix**: Make sure `pdp_nlns_operators.py` is in the same directory

### Issue 2: Still has violations
```
Final violations: 3
```
**Fix**: 
- Increase `max_iterations` (e.g., 1000)
- Increase `destroy_size_max` (e.g., 4)
- Run multiple times (ALNS is stochastic)

### Issue 3: Order 2 still unserved
```
Unserved orders: 1 (Order 2)
```
**Fix**: This order needs TruckLarge (12.0 capacity). Check if TruckLarge is being used efficiently. May need custom destroy operator that targets TruckLarge routes.

## üìä Operator Performance Analysis

After running, check which operators work best:

```
Operator Usage:
  Destroy operators:
    RandomRemoval       : 167 (33.4%), weight=1.245
    WorstRemoval        : 195 (39.0%), weight=1.456  ‚Üê Best!
    ShawRemoval         : 138 (27.6%), weight=0.987
  
  Repair operators:
    GreedyInsertion     : 278 (55.6%), weight=1.334
    Regret2Insertion    : 222 (44.4%), weight=1.198
```

Higher weight = better performance!

## üîÑ Comparison: Phase 0 vs Phase 1

| Metric | Phase 0 (Greedy) | Phase 1 (ALNS) | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Coverage | 91.7% | ~95-100% | +3-8% |
| Violations | 5 | 0-2 | -3 to -5 |
| Distance | 742.94 km | ~600-700 km | -10-20% |
| Feasibility | ‚úó | ‚úì | Fixed! |

## üéì Key ALNS Concepts

### 1. Adaptive Weights
Operators that find better solutions get higher weights ‚Üí used more often

### 2. Simulated Annealing
Accepts worse solutions early (exploration) ‚Üí only better solutions later (exploitation)

### 3. Destroy-Repair
Break solution apart ‚Üí rebuild better ‚Üí escape local optima

### 4. Operator Portfolio
Multiple operators work on different problem aspects:
- Random: Diversification
- Worst: Remove expensive routes
- Shaw: Exploit spatial/temporal clustering

## üöÄ Next Steps After Phase 1

Once ALNS works well, you can:

1. **Add more operators**:
   - Time-window destroy
   - Vehicle-restriction aware destroy
   - Capacity-based destroy

2. **Move to Phase 2 (RL)**:
   - Replace adaptive weights with neural network
   - Learn optimal operator selection
   - Use attention mechanisms

3. **Fine-tune parameters**:
   - Grid search for best temperature/cooling
   - Cross-validation on multiple instances

## üìù Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] All 11 files in directory (8 CSV + 3 new .py)
- [ ] Phase 0 tested and working
- [ ] Run `python test_phase1.py`
- [ ] Check output for improvements
- [ ] Analyze operator performance
- [ ] Tune parameters if needed

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Run multiple times**: ALNS is stochastic (different results each run)
2. **Save best solutions**: Modify code to save best solution to file
3. **Visualize routes**: Use matplotlib to plot routes (future enhancement)
4. **Track progress**: The iteration logs show convergence
